#Exploring Pre-trained Language Models for Event Extraction and Generation
- Sen Yang | Dawei Feng | Linbo Qiao | Zhigang Kan | Dongsheng Li
- first propose an event extraction model to overcome the roles overlap problem by separating the argument prediction in terms of roles.
Moreover, to address the problem of insufficient training data
